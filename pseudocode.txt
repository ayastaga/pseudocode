1. Printing multiples of five

FOR i from 1 to 100:
    IF i MOD 5 = 0 THEN:
        PRINT number
    END IF
END FOR

-----------------

2. Printing even numbers with user defined stopping point

GET stopping_point AS INT
SET counter to 0

WHILE counter <= stopping_point / 2:
    PRINT counter * 2
    INCREMENT counter by 1
END WHILE

-----------------

3.  Get 5 inputs, find & print average, min, and max

SET num_array to empty array
SET counter to 0 

WHILE counter < 5:
    GET num AS INT
    APPEND num to num_array
    INCREMENT counter by 1
END WHILE

SET sum_of_nums to (SUM of num_array)
SET average to (sum_of_nums / 5)

SET max_value to (MAX of num_array) 
SET min_value to (MIN of num_array)

PRINT average, min_value, max_value

-----------------

4.Reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order.

SET num_array to empty array
SET counter to 0

WHILE counter < 3:
    GET user_input AS INT
    APPEND user_input to num_array
    INCREMENT counter by 1
END WHILE

PRINT SORTED num_array

-----------------

5.Calculate a running sum. A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and 
when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and print out result 

GET user_input AS INT
SET counter to 0

WHILE user_input >= 0:
    INCREMENT counter by user_input
    GET user_input as INT
END WHILE

PRINT counter
